This study serves to analyze Uber and Lyft ride prices during a period of time in Boston.  We then use what we find to create models to further analyze the data.

The Capstone Project 1 Final file is all the Pyton code that I worked with in Jupyter Notebook. 
The Capstone Project written report pdf file is the detailed written report.
The Capstone 1 slides pdf is a slide deck for presentation.

Ultimately, we initially conclude that Uber prices are cheaper than Lyft given what we studied. This can be further analyzed by studying time series and potential trends in that area.
