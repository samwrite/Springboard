This study serves to analyze trends and patterns within Seattle Public Library checkouts. We then use what we find to create models to further analyze the data.

The Final Code file is all the Pyton code that I worked with in Jupyter Notebook. 
The Final Project pdf file is the detailed written report.
The Seattle Public Library Checkouts pdf is a slide deck for presentation.

Ultimately, we were able to find that Publication Year plays the biggest role in determining popularity for checked out items at the library.
